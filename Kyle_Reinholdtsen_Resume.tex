\section{Experience}

\cventry{01/2022--03/2023}{Software Engineer}{Husky Robotics}{University of Washington}{Seattle}{
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item Developed the mission control website for operating the team’s rover using JavaScript, React, and
    Redux.
    \begin{compactitem}
      \item Designed and implemented a custom WebSocket-based messaging protocol to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between the mission control website and the rover.
      \item Created UI elements to display rover camera feeds and telemetry data (position, power, velocity).
      \item Implemented a 3D rendering of the rover with React Three Fiber, dynamically updated in real-time using telemetry data.
    \end{compactitem}
    \item Developed a Unity simulator that emulates the rover’s cameras, motors, wheels, and sensors in a 3D
    virtual environment.
    \begin{compactitem}
      \item Enabled users to orbit the rover using intuitive mouse controls.
      \item Added functionality to configure intrinsic camera parameters within the simulator for enhanced simulation accuracy.
