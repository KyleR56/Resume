\section{Technical Experience}

\cventry{01/2022 -- 03/2023}{Software Engineer}{Husky Robotics, University of Washington}{Seattle}{}{
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item Built the mission control website for Husky Robotics, a student engineering team, to operate the teamâ€™s rover using JavaScript, React, and Redux.
    \item Maintained high code quality through Git-based collaboration, including feature branching, peer reviews, and issue tracking with detailed documentation.
    \item Designed and implemented a custom WebSocket-based JSON messaging protocol to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between the mission control website and the rover.
    \item Created UI elements to display rover camera feeds and telemetry data (position, power, velocity).
    \item Implemented a 3D rendering of the rover with React Three Fiber, dynamically updated in real-time using telemetry data.
  \end{compactitem}

\section{Projects}

\cventry{}{Paintle}{\href{https://paintle.net}{\textnormal{paintle.net}}}{\href{https://github.com/KyleR56/paintle-front-end}{\textnormal{GitHub}}}{}{
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item Created Paintle, a website inspired by Wordle where users solve a daily puzzle by painting a 5x5 grid.
    \item Built a responsive frontend using Angular, designed for seamless play on both desktop and mobile browsers.
    \item Deployed a fully serverless architecture on AWS using S3 (frontend), Lambda (backend logic), API Gateway (routing), and DynamoDB (storage), achieving <$200\,$ms cold-start latency and \$0 backend cost under typical usage.
    \item Implemented secure authentication via Google OAuth 2.0 and JSON Web Tokens (JWT), incorporating best practices such as short-lived tokens, RS256 asymmetric signing, and validation of token audience and issuer.
  \end{compactitem}
}

\cventry{}{MCQuest}{\href{https://github.com/KyleR56/mc-quest}{\textnormal{GitHub}}}{}{}{
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item Developed a custom Minecraft server to support a multiplayer RPG with questing, combat, and character progression.
    \item Collaborated with a 5-person team using Agile practices including structured requirements planning, sprint-based development, weekly standups, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure quality and fast iteration.
    \item Implemented backend systems in Java for handling in-game mechanics such as physics calculations, skill behavior, item interactions, and data persistence.
